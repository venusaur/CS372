    -How we fit into society 

Object Oriented Programming
    -How we thing about attibutes and behaviors, abstraction
    
    abstraction
      Abstraction means displaying only essential information and hiding the details. Data abstraction refers to providing only essential information 
      about the data to the outside world, hiding the background details or implementation.


Classes

      attributes 
        -Properties (varibles)
        - behaviors (methods); 

    -Constructors, methods and varibles
      

         
    -Const and Static 
         Static variable is visible only within the class, but its lifetime is the entire program. It continues to exist even if there are no objects of the class.
         A static data item is useful when all objects of the same class must share a common item of information.  
         A const member function guarantees that it will never modify any of its classâ€™s member data. 



    -Compositonal awareness  
      reuse already writen code 

    -Array and function interactions within classes
